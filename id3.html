When you're pushing the body outside the comfort zone, be mindful of overestimating your capacity for pain and undervaluing your body's basic needs for recovery.</p> <p> It should not shock you to learn that failure to embrace this logic will lead to a host of unpleasant outcomes. Rhobust exercise patterns without adequate nutrition and rest will ultimately yield symptoms such as fatigue, stress, irritability and even injury.</p> <p> Unfortunately though, some people forego these warnings and get overly entrenched in their new regime. This often leads to the discovery of unhealthy diets that are as dangerous as they are ludicrous.</p> <p> Here are some of the the world's most dangerous diets to look out for.</p> <h3> <strong> Tapeworm Diet</strong> </h3> <p> The tapeworm diet consists of ingesting a tapeworm cyst pill to allow tapeworms mature and eat all other food products inside your intestine to enhance weight loss . When the consumer reaches their weight loss target, they then swallow an anti-parasite pill to force the tapeworm out of the body through excretion.</p> <p> </p> <h6> Advertisement</h6> <p> Sound repulsive enough? Well don't return to your dinner just yet because the 'Tapeworm Diet' also includes a host of wicked side effects such as vomiting, diarrhoea, headaches and even epilipsy. Not only does this whole process deprive you of other vital nutrients, the weight dropped off during the diet will swiftly return when the parasite is killed.</p> <h3>  <strong> Hollywood Diet</strong> </h3> <p> </p> <p> via GIPHY </p> <p> Just like the perilous path to stardom, the 'Hollywood Diet' is paved with empty promises and dangerous deception. Also known as the ' 48-Hour Miracle Diet ', this diet plan is intended to produce a weight loss of between two and 10 pounds. Essentially, the product is an orange coloured drink which the dieter uses as a replacement for all other foods and liquids for two days. They take it four times a day and are encouraged to maintain this ritual until the desired weight loss is achieved.</p> <h6> Advertisement</h6> <p> Repeatedly following diet plans like this puts the body into starvation mode and can yield some nasty after effects such as  diarrhea, fatigue, constipation and nausea .</p> <h3> <strong> Baby Food Diet</strong> </h3> <p> <br> Pioneered by celebrity fitness coach Tracy Anderson, clients are encouraged to substitute good substantial meals with 14 tiny rations per day of puréed food and low-calorie dinners. Effectively, this is a nonsensical diet promoting adults to sacrifice their dignity and imitate the eating habits of infants. Of course, baby food is safe enough to eat but the minimal portions are insufficient for the amount of calories grown-ups need to function every day. It's also highly unsustainable.</p> <h3> <strong> K-E Diet, aka the Feeding-Tube Diet</strong> </h3> <p> Thought that feeding tubes were just for hospital patients? Well think again. 'The Feeding Tube Diet' is implemented by  inserting a thin tube through the dieter's nose where a substance made up of low calorie and low protein content is pumped through and deposited in the stomach.</p> <p> And the purpose of this absurd and totally elaborate process? It allegedly burns fat a faster rate.</p> <h6> Advertisement</h6> <p> Shockingly, this diet guarantees absolutely no long term weight loss and, more importantly, it is riddled with several unsavoury outcomes including constipation, kidney stones, dehydration, dizziness and headaches.</p> <h3> <strong> Werewolf Diet</strong> </h3> <p> Sounds like a manly one, but in reality, this diet is as primitive as howling at the moon. And wouldn't you know it, the inventors of this foolish diet are claiming that  weight loss can be influenced by lunar activity . Supposedly, if you fast during a full or new moon, it's gravitational pull will rapidly rid the body of up to six pounds of water weight and toxins. And if you can't abide by these instructions, you could at least restrict yourself to water and fruit juice.<br> <br> What worshippers of this diet don't realise, is that our kidneys naturally detoxify the body every day, making this whole farce of a diet completely redundant. The howlers can also look forward to side effects including  dizziness, fatigue, and irritability later.</p> <h3> <strong> The Lemonade Diet</strong> </h3> <p> </p> <p> via GIPHY </p> <h6> Advertisement</h6> <p> This one is an old favourite among desperate dieters and celebrities such as Beyoncé are avid users. The simple formula is to whip up a cocktail of water, lemon juice, cayenne pepper and maple syrup, and drink it down . You might lose some water weight but this is a diet with absolutely no longevity involved. And like so many other useless diets, you will eventually put all the weight back on, making weight loss even more difficult further down the line.</p> <h3> <strong> The Sleeping Beauty Diet</strong> </h3> <p> <br> Not too unlike the fabled story of Sleeping Beauty herself, this diet requires you to sleep through meal times. The rough guideline of 'The Sleeping Beauty Diet' is to force yourself into a drug induced coma that lasts for a few days. This is another assured method for self starvation accompanied by a delicious side serving of dehydration, decreased metabolism and muscle damage.</p> <h3> <strong> Cabbage Soup Diet</strong> </h3> <p> </p> <p> via GIPHY </p> <h6> Advertisement</h6> <p> The core message of this diet is to cut your advised daily intake down to 1,000 calories by dining solely on cabbage soup. There is no disputing the significance of having a diet rich in vegetables but dramatically removing all other food groups will leave your system deficient of some crucial vitamins . The additional health costs of this diet are migraines, eye discolouration, and depleted energy levels.</p> <h3> <strong> Cotton Ball Diet</strong> </h3> <p> <br> The thinking behind this diet is to replace all solid foods with cotton balls in an effort to negate your appetite. Without wanting to insult the intelligence of anyone who endorses this diet, eating cotton wool is a reasonable definition for stupidity. Eating wool not only interrupts the natural digestive processes, it also clogs up your system  which ultimately leaves you vulnerable to a whole host of health problems including bowel blockages.</p> <h3> <strong> Fork Diet</strong> </h3> <p> </p> <p> via GIPHY </p> <p> This is the mothership of all degenerative diet ideas and if you're sill enough to follow it, you won't be encountering any forks in the road on your journey to malnutrition. Put plainly, the 'Fork Diet' compels its users to  eat food portions that are smaller than the size of your fork . It's a simple idea don't you agree? Possibly because the person who conceived it was so delirious with the hunger that they couldn't come up with anything more complex.</p> <h3> <strong> Read more: </strong> <strong> George Hook's Proposed Next Move Will Push Him Further Into The Limelight</strong> </h3> <p> </p> <br> <h5> Related Articles</h5> Fuel 1 week ago <br/> By Balls Team Watch: The Very First Spinning Video Fuel 2 weeks ago <br/> By Balls Team The Power Of Raw Hamburger Shakes And Other Diet Tips From Bruce Lee Fuel 1 month ago <br/> By Balls Team The Incredible Story Of The 59-Year-Old Irishman Who Now Holds A Marathon World Record <span> </span> <span> Previous</span> <span> </span> <span> Next</span> <h5> Tags:</h5> <h5> Share this article</h5> <i> </i> <i> </i> <i> </i> <i> </i><br>
